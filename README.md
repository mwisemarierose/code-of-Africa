## Interactive Photo Gallery
## Overview

The interactive photo gallery is a responsive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following the provided Figma designs provided. It allows users to view and interact with a collection of photos, including hover interactions and full-size image viewing.

## Features

- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
- Pixel-perfect implementation of the Figma designs
- Hover interaction displaying additional photo details
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Clean and well-structured code

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mwisemarierose/code-of-Africa`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your clone directory`
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

Once the application is loaded in your browser, you can:

- Browse through the photo thumbnails
- Hover over a photo to view additional details
- Click on a photo to view the full-size image
- Navigate between full-size images using the provided controls

## Coding Challenges

This repository also includes solutions to two coding challenges:

1. **Array Manipulation**: Determine if a contiguous subarray within an array sums up to a given target value.
2. **String Transformation**: Transform a string based on specific rules, involving reversing the string, replacing characters with ASCII codes, or both.

The solutions to these challenges can be found in the `Challenges` folder, with files named `arrayMap.js` and `stringTransform.js`, respectively.

1. Navigate to the Challenges directory: `cd Challenges`
2. Open your terminal and run any of the challenges by running `node arrayMap.js` or `node stringTransform.js`
2. You can visualize in the terminal the output of the challenge you run as there is some examples already in thw code
